# Background
- Exploring CMS data
- CMS data contains provider information along with: 
  - NPI - National Provider Identifier
  - Provider Name
  - HCPCS Code
  - HCPCS Description Code
  - Provider Type 
  - Cost
  
# Use Case
- To run a exploratory analysis on the data
- To identify the primary fields, must have and nice of have fields
- To identify relationships
For example: 
- A doctor(a.k.a provider) can perform at multiple locations
- A facility(a.k.a provider) can perform at multiple locations
- What are the reasons due to which record of provider(doctor or facility) can have multiple rows? 
- Is there a distinguisher column of doctor or facility? 
- Can we identify the doctor working in the facility using the dataset? 
- Can we check how many procedures have no doctors? 
- Can we check how many procedures have no facilities? 
- Any value proposition features that can be derived out of this dataset? '

(Please note, I have used 2017 - (recently updated) dataset for the analysis, and referred to other years dataset to check any unexpected change in numbers)
